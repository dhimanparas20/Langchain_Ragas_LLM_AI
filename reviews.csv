TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!,"TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!! My startup was urgently needing a business bank account and the RBS offer of 2 years fee free banking popped up. I went through the lengthy process of applying, both myself and the other director provided all details for AML checks. I heard nothing for 10 days so call them and am informed that the application has been cancelled as I am not based in Scotland and instead would have to apply for a Natwest account which takes 3 - 4 weeks! Why no communication in the last 10 days and why did the website allow me to even submit the application and then ask for documents to be sent to them?? These people seems to be utterly incompetent and lacking in basic common sense... horrible experience! Steer clear of Natwest and RBS if you want to save yourself a lot of time and headaches.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,6 days ago

Tetiana and Sergei,"My name is Sergey and I'll explain about my girlfriend's experience. Her name is Tetiana. She's very upset because of the very poor and subjective phone customer service! NatWest blocked her mobile app which is fair enough, and then the poor customer service began. I helped her to do everything correctly, including face and passport verification, but it was a great loss of time and hopes. The worst person called Michael, from 08001615165, decided that she must go to the local office and wrote that in her case records. Then every single attempt to unblock the mobile app was with the answer to go to the local office. Consequences are that she will loose 5 hours working time which costs her ¬£60. Who's going to compensate her? It must be NatWest or that person called Michael!

Every transaction total shown horizontally and overall total on the top of the account. It is clear for customer how much added and how much spend exact transaction and date,Natwest doesn't show transactions total horizontaly. They show the  total  only on the top of account. This give them plenty of opportunity to steal money from customers.They easily can move figurs, change figures to justify lose of assets. In credit card they don't show refunds especially people like me who like to shop online. For example, didn't show car insurance refunds ¬£60, Amazon refunds very often, and online companies olso refund when the goods I sent back. APP is a great help which I check daily. In March they showed I was in debt ¬£70. I don't like depts and I am very organised financially. I pay everything on time. Refunded ¬£50 but ¬£70 is still there. Eventually, I investigated all transactions and found out they owed me ¬£240 refund never shown.Complaint team declared will investigate which will take 40 working days. For me, it took two hours to find out. Eventually, they sent me a message saying as a gesture of goodwill ¬£70 I didn't pay. The message didn't accept a reply. It was very frustrating for me. The 1st of August I went Ipswich branch to open new saving account follow their advice on telephone which will give me opportunity close existing one which had limited access. I paid ¬£200 the agent to credit new Flexible saving account and ¬£100 in current account. The agent said me that tomorrow 2nd of August I will see new Flexible  account with ¬£200. Next day there wasn't Flexable account no ¬£200 and ¬£100. I call NatWest the lady said ¬£300 transferred into my existing saving account which I didn't want and it accepts only ¬£50 a monthly. . I said it's not true. I suppose to have Flexible account ¬£200 in and ¬£100 should be in my current account. What about my existing saving account amount doesn't have anything to do with ¬£300 which yesterday I paid in different accounts.

I have dual citizenship so wish to update the application with the bank to my other nationality.So Natwest resubmits Hooyu process again, which I dutifully complete with new passport etc.Then a week later, Natwest requests that I do the Hooyu process *again* for a 3rd time. On this 3rd attempt, it now requires either a ""Travel Visa"" or a ""Residence Card"" as 2nd evidence of identity. I have neither of those, as I am a full British Citizen with a passport. But submitting my British passport, along with my other nationality, ""fails"" in the logic of Hooyu. There is no support to call, no one you can go to for help or assistance. Just a ""computer says no"" experience. Natwest have not responded to my pleas for assistance. Strikes me that they are going out of their way to say ""We don't want your business. Unless you are turning over ¬£1M+, just forget it"".Natwest / Hooyu - it is working. I will make it my personal business to make sure I *never* bank with you. As for Hooyu development team, your identity experience is appalling. What ever happened to going into a bank, seeing your business manager, and setting up an account in 20mins?",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,30 Mar 2023
If I could put Minus 10 stars I would,"If I could put Minus 10 stars I would. It has now been over 4 months since We applied to switch our Business Account finally this happened last week. Received 2 letters and emails confirming this and that my other Business Account that we switched from was closed and all of information the information had been transferred. Guess what I went to pay our staff today and there details weren‚Äôt there and as I said we have letters stating what they had passed Across to Nat West !! So I phoned the switch team and they said I would have to call Business Customer Service. Which I did and explained everything to the young man who said he didn‚Äôt know what to do and could he put me on hold, so I was on hold 5+ minutes then a young lady answered saying complaints I said I hope her colleague had explained ‚ÄúGuess what no all he done was transferred the Call this has happened several times over the past 4 months. So I had to explain it all again and all went silent for a couple minutes so I said ‚Äúare you still there?‚Äù Got ‚Äúyes‚Äù she said she was sorry but there was nothing she could do ‚Äú INTERESTING REMOTE WORKER LITTLE KNOWLEDGE AND SHE COULD NOT PASS TO A MANAGER???!‚ÄùSo I asked her to contact the switch team and call me back?She did callback with absolutely nothing to help me. I told her I was on holiday and would have to travel home to get all the employees details to pay them. No help only she would open another complaint and escalate it!Where has the days gone when if you had to end up Complaining. The people knew what there business done and would take ownership and sort. Totally fed up she was useless I did tell her and said I m not having a go at you , however she should not be working remotely not knowing how to manage complaints. She again said sorry ‚ÄúTHAT DOESN‚Äôt HELP‚Äù and she would not pass me to a manager. She also tried to blame my old Bank which I had contacted already however as I had closed the account the only information they could give me was send by post the last 3 months statements. So she doesn‚Äôt know the Banking Code. Oh well here‚Äôs to a 3 hour trip home so my staff get paid.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28 Jun 2024
"Business review portal has failings, help team can't help","We've recently failed multiple times to complete a business review despite being a NatWest business customer for over 20 years.NatWest withdrew our access to our account on 18th Feb (as threatened) despite us uploading the requested documents several times and us explaining we needed more time due to a planned holiday. This was ignored even though at this point both us and NatWest staff were locked out of our portal. We returned on the 3rd March unable to access our accounts with payments not being received or sent. Ater multiple calls to the help team, and a letter to prove our business partnership being rejected (despite us having it adjusted by our accountants numerous times to fit the requirements) we visited our nearest branch (40 mile round trip). Refusing to leave the bank managers office until sorted was the only way we've been able to gain access to our account. I feel the behaviour of NatWest has been a violation. I am thankful that we didn't have mortgage payments, house insurance or vehicle insurance payments to make from that account and default on and that we are fortunate enough to have enough money in a personal account until we were able to have access to our money again. I have felt extremely upset, frustrated and powerless throughout this process and so angry that a bank we have used for over 20 years left us in a position of not being able to function. I'm not sure what position we'd be in had we defaulted on an insurance payment during this experience that we later required.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,21 Mar 2024
NATWEST BULLYING AND INEFFICIENCY,"My business is 35 years old. We are small, but trade internationally in USD and EUR. We have NEVER overdrawn and always maintain healthy account balances for which we receive no interest. We have banked with Natwest for 12 years. BUT NEVER AGAIN.In March this year, I began receiving emails (followed by letters) telling me that we had to go online and provide information for a ""business review""; and that if we did not do so by a certain date, access to our accounts (ie money) might be suspended. The process was long drawn out, required lots of data to be researched for answers, and was not helped by broken links and a dysfunctional web site that crashed several times during inputs. A few days later, we received a ""reminder"" (for an email we never received) telling us the information was incomplete, and now threatening a fairly imminent suspension of our accounts. To make a long story short, we received many more of these ""reminders"" over the ensuing weeks, each telling us the infomation we had provided was unaccepted or incomplete, and many times we had to answer ridiculous requests for information that should have been obvious to Natwest from the information they already had (like ""We have observed that your overheads have increased this year. Please explain.""). Clearly a poorly written AI system was behind much of this.The threats of accounts suspension came thick and fast, despite us responding immediately to every request. Finally they acknowldged that we had answered all questions satisfactorily, but we never ever received a message saying the case was closed. In the meantime, fearing for the consequences of an abrupt closure of our accounts and loss of funds, we set up alternative accounts with another bank, which wasted a lot of time but was essential as a counter measure to maintain business continuity.I complained to Natwest's Chief Executive about this ridiculous process, and the constant threats and bullying we had endured. The matter was referred to an agent who apologised, paid us ¬£250 in compensation (paltry considering the time we had wasted on this, and the extreme stress caused) and sent a very nice hamper. we were assured lessons had been learned and that nothing like this would happen again.I was on the point of moving our funds back to Natwest, when the whole process unbelievably began all over again!!!!! Yet another email ""reminder"" for us to complete the review, or our accounts would be suspended in days.I have now lost patience, and wrote to Natwest telling them to close our accounts. 9 days later, they have done nothing, except levy bank charges that have overdrawn one of the accounts, for which I am now receiving text messages . . . . with threats of account suspension!!!!It's a bad joke: Natwest could easily have destroyed my business. And this is the bank WE have all paid to bail out after their behaviour in the banking crisis. They have learned nothing, except how to keep paying their fat cat salaries.SORRY, IF YOU BANK WITH NATWEST AFTER READING THIS, YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING YOU GET. NEXT TIME, IT WILL BE YOU.",Rated 1 out of 5 stars,18 Jul 2024
